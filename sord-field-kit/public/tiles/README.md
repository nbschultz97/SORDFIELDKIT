# PMTiles Drop Zone

Place a file named `basemap.pmtiles` in this folder to override the default online demo tiles.

On GitHub Mobile you can upload via **Add file â†’ Upload files**, then browse to a PMTiles archive stored on your phone. The service worker will prefer this local file when available so the map keeps working offline after you toggle the offline cache.
